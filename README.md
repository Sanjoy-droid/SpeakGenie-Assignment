# SpekaGennie Assignment

A lightweight **Next.js 16** project built as part of the SpekaGennie assignment.
The setup is minimal so you can clone the repo, install dependencies, and start the dev server instantly.

## How to Run

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Sanjoy-droid/SpeakGenie-Assignment.git
cd spekagennie-assignment
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the server starts, open:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

The app supports hot-reloading, so any changes you make will update automatically.
